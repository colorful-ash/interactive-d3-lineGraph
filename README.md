# interactive-d3-lineGraph
Interactive line graph built with d3.js. Has transitions, multiple TSV data file sources, tooltips and more! 

Hello fellow d3.js enthusiasts,
  I am a d3 newbie who is learning d3.js on the side. I am exploring ways to make boring charts more fun with transitions and     interactions. 
  This repository contains code that is part of a larger project of mine: I am trying to build a dashboard which    contains d3   charts representing an economic comparison between 2 countries: India and the USA. Tn this particular repository, I depict the   increasing population trend in these countries from 1990 - 2014. The data source is from The United Nations Population          Division's World Population Prospects.
  I have tried my best to comment on most of the functionalities in the myd3script.js file. Hope this helps other aspiring d3     experts too! Have fun!
